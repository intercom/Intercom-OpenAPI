        for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's `id`.\n\n> \U0001F4D8 Metadata
        behaviour\n>\n> - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to
        10 per event. Once the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive.
        The first 10 metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent
        in with the event.\n> - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once
        the event has been sent. A new event will need to be created with the new
        keys and you can archive the old one.\n> - There might be up to 24 hrs delay
        when you send a new metadata for an existing event.\n\n> \U0001F4D8 Event
        de-duplication\n>\n> The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each
        event is uniquely identified as a combination of the following data - the
        Workspace identifier, the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name
        and the Data Event created time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended**
        to send a second granularity Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.\n>\n>
        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code -
        an error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any
        rate limit that is in place.\n\n### HTTP API Responses\n\n- Successful responses
        to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty body.\n- Unauthorised
        access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response
        code.\n- Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not
        Found`.\n- Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates
        ignored.\n- Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain
        an error message in the body.\n\n"
