The default is `50` results per page.\n  See the [pagination section](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/rest-apis/pagination/#example-search-conversations-request) for more details on how to use the `starting_after` param.\n{% /admonition %}\n### Contact Creation Delay\n\nIf a contact has recently been created, there is a possibility that it will not yet be available when searching. This means that it may not appear in the response. This delay can take a few minutes. If you need to be instantly notified it is recommended to use webhooks and iterate to see if they match your search filters.\n\n### Nesting & Limitations\n\nYou can nest these filters in order to get even more granular insights that pinpoint exactly what you need. Example: (1 OR 2) AND (3 OR 4).\nThere are some limitations to the amount of multiple's there can be:\n* There's a limit of max 2 nested filters\n* There's a limit of max 15 filters for each AND or OR group\n\n### Searching for Timestamp Fields\n\nAll timestamp fields (created_at, updated_at etc.) are indexed as Dates for Contact Search queries; Datetime queries are not currently supported. This means you can only query for timestamp fields by day - not hour, minute or second.\nFor example, if you search for all Contacts with a created_at value greater (>) than 1577869200 (the UNIX timestamp for January 1st, 2020 9:00 AM), that will be interpreted as 1577836800 (January 1st, 2020 12:00 AM). The search results will then include Contacts created from January 2nd, 2020 12:00 AM onwards.\nIf you'd like to get contacts created on January 1st, 2020 you should search with a created_at value equal (=) to 1577836800 (January 1st, 2020 12:00 AM).\nThis behaviour applies only to timestamps used in search queries. The search results will still contain the full UNIX timestamp and be sorted accordingly.\n\n### Accepted Fields\n\nMost key listed as part of the Contacts Model are searchable, whether writeable or not. The value you search for has to match the accepted type, otherwise the query will fail (ie. as `created_at` accepts a date, the `value` cannot be a string such as `\"foorbar\"`).\n\n| Field                              | Type                           |\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| id                                 | String                         |\n| role                               | String<br>Accepts user or lead |\n| name                               | String                         |\n| avatar                             | String                         |\n| owner_id                           | Integer                        |\n| email                              | String                         |\n| email_domain                       | String                         |\n| phone                              | String                         |\n| external_id                        | String                         |\n| created_at                         | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| signed_up_at                       | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| updated_at                         | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| last_seen_at                       | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| last_contacted_at                  | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| last_replied_at                    | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| last_email_opened_at               | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| last_email_clicked_at              | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| language_override                  | String                         |\n| browser                            | String                         |\n| browser_language                   | String                         |\n| os                                 | String                         |\n| location.country                   | String                         |\n| location.region                    | String                         |\n| location.city                      | String                         |\n| unsubscribed_from_emails           | Boolean                        |\n| marked_email_as_spam               | Boolean                        |\n| has_hard_bounced                   | Boolean                        |\n| ios_last_seen_at                   | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| ios_app_version                    | String                         |\n| ios_device                         | String                         |\n| ios_app_device                     | String                         |\n| ios_os_version                     | String                         |\n| ios_app_name                       | String                         |\n| ios_sdk_version                    | String                         |\n| android_last_seen_at               | Date (UNIX Timestamp)          |\n| android_app_version                | String                         |\n| android_device                     | String                         |\n| android_app_name                   | String                         |\n| andoid_sdk_version                 | String                         |\n| segment_id                         | String                         |\n| tag_id                             | String                         |\n| custom_attributes.{attribute_name} | String                         |\n\n### Accepted Operators\n\n{% admonition type=\"warning\" name=\"Searching based on `created_at`\" %}\n  You cannot use the `<=` or `>=` operators to search by `created_at`.\n{% /admonition %}\n\nThe table below shows the operators you can use to define how you want to search for the value.

The default is `20` results per page and maximum is `150`.\n  See the [pagination section](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/rest-apis/pagination/#example-search-conversations-request) for more details on how to use the `starting_after` param.\n{% /admonition %}\n\n### Nesting & Limitations\n\nYou can nest these filters in order to get even more granular insights that pinpoint exactly what you need. Example: (1 OR 2) AND (3 OR 4).\nThere are some limitations to the amount of multiple's there can be:\n- There's a limit of max 2 nested filters\n- There's a limit of max 15 filters for each AND or OR group\n\n### Accepted Fields\n\nMost keys listed in the conversation model is searchable, whether writeable or not. The value you search for has to match the accepted type, otherwise the query will fail (ie. as `created_at` accepts a date, the `value` cannot be a string such as `\"foorbar\"`).\nThe `source.body` field is unique as the search will not be performed against the entire value, but instead against every element of the value separately. For example, when searching for a conversation with a `\"I need support\"` body - the query should contain a `=` operator with the value `\"support\"` for such conversation to be returned. A query with a `=` operator and a `\"need support\"` value will not yield a result.\n\n| Field                                     | Type

The final parameter is a map that can be used to send optional metadata about the event.\n\nWith the Ruby client you pass a hash describing the event to `Intercom::Event.create`, or call the `track_user` method directly on the current user object (e.g. `user.track_event`).\n\n**NB: For the JSON object types, please note that we do not currently support nested JSON structure.**\n\n| Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                                                                           |\n| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| String          | The value is a JSON String                                                                                                                                                                                      | `\"source\":\"desktop\"`                                                              |\n| Number          | The value is a JSON Number                                                                                                                                                                                      | `\"load\": 3.67`                                                                    |\n| Date            | The key ends with the String `_date` and the value is a [Unix timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), assumed to be in the [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) timezone. | `\"contact_date\": 1392036272`                                                      |\n| Link            | The value is a HTTP or HTTPS URI.                                                                                                                                                                               | `\"article\": \"https://example.org/ab1de.html\"`                                     |\n| Rich Link       | The value is a JSON object that contains `url` and `value` keys.                                                                                                                                                | `\"article\": {\"url\": \"https://example.org/ab1de.html\", \"value\":\"the dude abides\"}` |\n| Monetary Amount | The value is a JSON object that contains `amount` and `currency` keys.

Once the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive. The first 10 metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are sent in with the event.\n- It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been sent. A new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can archive the old one.\n- There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an existing event.\n\n**Event de-duplication**\n\nThe API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace identifier, the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the Data Event created time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to send a second granularity Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.\n\nDuplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code - an error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted against any rate limit that is in place.\n\n### HTTP API Responses\n\n- Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an empty body.\n- Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response code.\n- Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not Found`.\n- Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates ignored.\n- Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an error message in the body.\n\n",
