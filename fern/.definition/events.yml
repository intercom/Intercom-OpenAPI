        You will need an Access Token that has write permissions to send Events.
        Once you have a key you can submit events via POST to the Events
        resource, which is located at https://api.intercom.io/events, or you can
        send events using one of the client libraries. When working with the
        HTTP API directly a client should send the event with a `Content-Type`
        of `application/json`.


        When using the JavaScript API, [adding the code to your
        app](http://docs.intercom.io/configuring-Intercom/tracking-user-events-in-your-app)
        makes the Events API available. Once added, you can submit an event
        using the `trackEvent` method. This will associate the event with the
        Lead or currently logged-in user or logged-out visitor/lead and send it
        to Intercom. The final parameter is a map that can be used to send
        optional metadata about the event.


        With the Ruby client you pass a hash describing the event to
        `Intercom::Event.create`, or call the `track_user` method directly on
        the current user object (e.g. `user.track_event`).


        **NB: For the JSON object types, please note that we do not currently
        support nested JSON structure.**

        **Lead Events**


        When submitting events for Leads, you will need to specify the Lead's
        `id`.


        **Metadata behaviour**


        - We currently limit the number of tracked metadata keys to 10 per
        event. Once the quota is reached, we ignore any further keys we receive.
        The first 10 metadata keys are determined by the order in which they are
        sent in with the event.

        - It is not possible to change the metadata keys once the event has been
        sent. A new event will need to be created with the new keys and you can
        archive the old one.

        - There might be up to 24 hrs delay when you send a new metadata for an
        existing event.


        **Event de-duplication**


        The API may detect and ignore duplicate events. Each event is uniquely
        identified as a combination of the following data - the Workspace
        identifier, the Contact external identifier, the Data Event name and the
        Data Event created time. As a result, it is **strongly recommended** to
        send a second granularity Unix timestamp in the `created_at` field.


        Duplicated events are responded to using the normal `202 Accepted` code
        - an error is not thrown, however repeat requests will be counted
        against any rate limit that is in place.


        ### HTTP API Responses


        - Successful responses to submitted events return `202 Accepted` with an
        empty body.

        - Unauthorised access will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` or `403
        Forbidden` response code.

        - Events sent about users that cannot be found will return a `404 Not
        Found`.

        - Event lists containing duplicate events will have those duplicates
        ignored.

        - Server errors will return a `500` response code and may contain an
        error message in the body.

      errors:
        - root.UnauthorizedError

        > Please note that you can only 'list' events that are less than 90 days
        old. Event counts and summaries will still include your events older
        than 90 days but you cannot 'list' these events individually if they are
        older than 90 days


        The events belonging to a customer can be listed by sending a GET
        request to `https://api.intercom.io/events` with a user or lead
        identifier along with a `type` parameter. The identifier parameter can
        be one of `user_id`, `email` or `intercom_user_id`. The `type` parameter
        value must be `user`.


        - `https://api.intercom.io/events?type=user&user_id={user_id}`

        - `https://api.intercom.io/events?type=user&email={email}`

        - `https://api.intercom.io/events?type=user&intercom_user_id={id}` (this
        call can be used to list leads)


        The `email` parameter value should be [url
        encoded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) when sending.


        You can optionally define the result page size as well with the
        `per_page` parameter.
