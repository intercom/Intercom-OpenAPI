  With the "Custom Channel" integration, you can bring Fin and Intercom
  capabilities to your own platform via API, enabling powerful custom
  integrations.


  Intercom treats your integration like any other Intercom channel, allowing
  your application and Intercom to exchange events seamlessly. This makes it
  possible, for example, for your users to interact with Fin directly within
  your own applicationâ€™s UI.


  > **Note:** "Fin over API" is currently under managed availability. Please
  reach out to your accounts team to discuss access and tailored, hands-on
  support.
