    docs: >-
      Jobs are tasks that are processed asynchronously by the Intercom system
      after being enqueued via the API. This allows for efficient handling of
      operations that may take time to complete, such as data imports or
      exports. You can check the status of your jobs to monitor their progress
      and ensure they are completed successfully.
