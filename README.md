## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

The Intercom API can empower [Fin.ai](https://www.intercom.com/fin), Intercom’s AI assistant for customer support and automation.
You can use the API to create and edit the articles that Fin uses when answering customers' questions.
The API can also set data like conversation and user attributes to be referenced by Fin Guidance or control the flow of automations like Fin Procedures.

**Fin Procedures**
Define multi-step actions that Fin can execute through the API to handle structured or recurring workflows.
